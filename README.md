# Chapter 1 Assignment

My approach for this assignment was largely to follow the guide layed
out by the Code Rails book.  Everything went smoothly for the most
part except I had some issues with the server timing out when I began
trying to make `visit` requests with capybara.  I used an options hash I found
at http://qiita.com/meganii/items/044c606f34918d866a61 - I'm not sure
who specifically to attribute credit to as the site is in Japanese.  I
also used the documentation and/or readmes for capybara and
poltergeist to help get setup.
